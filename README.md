This a crew Ai implementation

### It's a 991 Dispatcher that takes a distress message(String)

notifies the appropriate services like(police,EMS,firefighters),currently it drafts emails to them "obviously doesn't send them anywhere right now"
and gives instructions to the caller to follow till help arrives
it only takes the distress call as input and outputs everything in terminal

distress call can be something like - "There is a crocodile loose in the walmart on 5th avenue,it has attacked 2 people,please advice on what to do, there are a lot of people here"
